# Shell Basics Scripts

This repository contains a set of shell scripts that perform various basic tasks. These scripts were created as part of the ALX School System Engineering and DevOps program.

## Getting Started

To use these scripts, you should have access to a Unix/Linux terminal. You can run the scripts by navigating to the directory where they are located and executing them with the bash shell.

```bash
./script-name
Make sure to make the script executable using chmod if necessary, as specified in the requirements.

bash
Copy code
chmod u+x script-name
